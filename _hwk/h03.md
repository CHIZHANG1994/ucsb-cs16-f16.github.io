Section 1.3 discusses the need to declare variables.  If your previous programming experience was with Java, the need to declare variables is nothing new to you, but if your previous experience was in Python, this is a new concept.   Every variable must be "declared" on first appearance, and given a fixed type.  

Sections 2.2 and 2.3 discuss various data types in C++.   You can also read about data types in C++ on the course website under the topic [C++: Data Types](https://ucsb-cs16.github.io/topics/cpp_data_types/)   

Write variable declarations for the following, according to the instructions.  Remember that variable declarations are statements, and so must end in a semicolon.   Comments do not need to end in a semicolon.
