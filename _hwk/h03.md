Read Chapter 2 (If you don't have a copy of the textbook yet, there is one on reserve at the library under "COMP000-STAFF - Permanent Reserve").

<ol markdown="1">
1.	(2 pts) Show 2 different ways to initialize variables in C++?
  <div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>

2.	(2 pts) Is this variable declaration statement in C++ a good one? Why or why not?
  <div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>

3.	(2 pts) How do you write in ONE LINE in C++: Add a to b and subtract that sum from c, then divide that result by d?
  <div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>

4.	(4 pts) What will appear on the monitor/display when the following C++ statement is executed?
  <div style="margin-bottom:8em"></div>

5.	(10 pts) Write a short program that asks the user to input three double type inputs from the keyboard, the program then shows the user what the two numbers entered was. It then multiplies them together, and displays the answer within 4 decimal places.
  <div class="pagebreak"></div>

6.	(2 pts) What will the following statements print out in C++?  
    <div style="margin-bottom:0.5em"></div>
cout >> "I love oranges and apples";

  <div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>
  
8.	(16 pts) Write a C++ program that takes as input from the user, their favorite integer number and their name. The program then, says "Hello, (user's name here), your favorite number is (user's favorit number here)!". Then the program will will multiply the number they gave you by 5, then multiply that result again by 5, then multiply THAT result AGAIN by 5. The program HAS to do so using one of the C++ shorthands we discussed in class.
Finally, the program should say "I took your number and multiplied it by 5 THREE times and the result was: (the resulting number here)."
You CANNOT write this program using ANY loop statements.
