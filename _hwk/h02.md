Reading: Read Chapter 3, pp. 110-164. (If you don't
have a copy of the textbook yet, there is one on reserve at the
library.)

Then, answer the following questions. Be sure to check both sides.

Reading: Read Chapter 2, pp.41-97. (If you don't
have a copy of the textbook yet, there is one on reserve at the
library.) Then, answer the following questions. Be sure to check both
sides.

2.  Section 3.1 discusses boolean expressions.
    1.  (4 pts) What do we mean when we say "boolean expression"?
        <div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>
    2.  (3 pts) What do we mean when we say "short-circuit evaluation"?
        <div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>
    3.  (8 pts) The text discusses why we have to be careful with
        boolean values that convert to int values with the example
        
        ```
        if (!time > limit)
        ```
        Based on what you read in that section, explain why the following code
        can NEVER print "Freezing" no matter what value is entered for
        temperature by the user:
        
        ```
            int temperature;
            cout >> "Enter the temperature";
            cin >> temperature;
            if (!temperature >= 32)
              cout << "Freezing" << endl;
        ```
        <div class="pagebreak"></div>

3.  Section 3.2 discusses multi-way branches and the "dangling else"
    problem, multi-way branches, and the switch statement.
    1.  (2 pts) What is the dangling else problem, and how is it solved?
        <div style="margin-bottom:3em"></div>
    2.  (2 pts) What is the purpose of a "default" clause in a switch
        statement?
        <div style="margin-bottom:3em"></div>
    3.  (2 pts) What happens if you forget a "break" at the bottom of a
        "case" in a switch statement?
        <div style="margin-bottom:3em"></div>
    4.  (2 pts) In display 3.8 on p. 136, at line 28, there is a
        variable called "subtotal" that has an arrow pointing to it with
        the label "local to the block". What does this "local to the
        block" business mean?
        <div style="margin-bottom:3em"></div>
    5.  (3 pts) When we talk about a "block" in C++ programming, what
        are we talking about?
        <div style="margin-bottom:3em"></div>

4.  Section 3.3 goes into more detail that previous sections about while
    loops and introduces the for loop.
    1.  (6 pts) A for loop header has three parts:
        <div style="width: 35%; float: right" markdown="1">
        ```    
        for (part1;part2;part3) {
               doSomething;
            }
        ```
        </div>
        What are these three parts, and what does each part do?

        *   part1:
            <div style="margin-bottom:3em"></div>
        *   part2:
            <div style="margin-bottom:3em"></div>
        *   part3:
            <div style="margin-bottom:3em"></div>

    2.  (2 pts) Typically you should NOT put a semicolon at the end of a
        for loop statement. But if you do, it isn't a syntax error. And,
        unlike Python, C++ ignores indentation (although proper
        indentation should STILL BE DONE for the sake of humans reading
        your code.)
        How many times will "Hi" be printed by this code (which has a
        semicolon where it SHOULD NOT BE)?
       
        ```cpp
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++); 
               cout << "Hi!" << endl;
        ```
        <div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>
        
    3.  (2 pts) How about now---how many times will "Hi" be printed by
        this same code, with the semicolon removed?
        
        ```cpp
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
               cout << "Hi!" << endl;
        ```
        <div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>

5.  Section 3.4 discusses the design of programs that use loops. Even
    though C++ may be new to you, the ideas about loops in this section
    should be somewhat familiar to you from previous coursework in
    programming, including how to use loops to accumulate a sum, how to
    use nested loopsâ€”even so, there may be some new and useful ideas in
    this section even for very experienced programmers. It is well worth
    reading in detail, not just for the answers to the questions below.
    1.  (2 pts) When accumulating a sum, we initialize the sum variable
        to what value?
        <div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>

    2.  (2 pts) What is a "sentinel" value?
        <div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>
