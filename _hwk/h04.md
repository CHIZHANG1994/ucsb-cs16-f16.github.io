Write an if-else statement that outputs the word
High if the value of the variable score is greater
than 100 and Low if the value of score is at most
100? The variables are of type int. 

Show the output of this code if x is of type int?
x = 10;
while ( x > 0)
 {
 cout << x << endl;
 x = x â€“ 3;
 }
 
Write a program that ask the user what shape they want to find the area to: a rectangle, a triangle, a trapezoid, or a circle. Based on the user choice, get the pertinent parameters from the user and then calculate the area.
Plan this out well: what are the variables that you'll need? What type will each be?
You must:
	a) Utilize comments in the program to tell us what you're doing
	b) Declare at least one constant in the program
	c) Format your answers so that they are readable on the display. This means watch for your use of "\n" characters and for formatting of decimal places in displayed numbers.
	d) Test this program out by compiling it and running it. 
When you are sure that you have a working program, attach a print out of it to this homework sheet - REMEMBER TO PUT YOUR FULL NAME AND ID# ON THIS SHEET! You will be graded for programming style as well as for functionality correctness.

Write a while loop that prints out these 11 lines: 
"COUNTDOWN TO ZERO: 10"
"COUNTDOWN TO ZERO: 9"
...
"COUNTDOWN TO ZERO: 1"
"COUNTDOWN TO ZERO: LIFT OFF!"

What is the result of the following Boolean operations, given that: x = 7, y = 10, z = 12
a) (x == 6)
b) !(y > 0)
b) ((x == 6) || (y < 20))
c) ((x >= 3) && (z <= 12))
d) ((x > y) && (y < z))
e) ((!(x < z) || (y > z)) && (z == 12) && (y == 10))
